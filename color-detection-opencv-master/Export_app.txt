How to export your PyQt (and OpenCV/matplotlib) app as a standalone executable (no Python needed):

1. Install PyInstaller:
   pip install pyinstaller

2. Package your app:
   cd /path/to/your/project
   pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed RUN_GUI.py
   - --onefile: single executable
   - --windowed: no terminal window (for GUI apps)

3. Find your executable in the dist folder:
   dist/RUN_GUI   (or RUN_GUI.exe on Windows)

4. Distribute:
   Share the file in dist/. No Python installation needed for users.

Notes:
- If you use images, config files, or other resources, add them with --add-data:
  pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed --add-data "myicon.png:." RUN_GUI.py
- On Linux, build on the oldest system you want to support for best compatibility.
- For Windows, build on Windows; for Linux, build on Linux.

Summary:
- Use PyInstaller to create a standalone app.
- Distribute the file in dist/.
- No Python installation is needed for end users.
